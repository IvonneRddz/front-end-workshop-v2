# Front-End challenges

Welcome to my workshop about how to become a Front-End developer. The best way to learn is by practicing and resolve some exercises about the topics that we have seen.

### 1. HTML/CSS Challenge

You have to create a repo in your profile named **html-css-challenge** and you must to [create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) and assign me as reviewer in order to give you a feedback.

For the first project, you should create a simple page about yourself. You can take as reference the next design:

**extra small**

![extra small](resources/xsmall.png?raw=true "extra small")

**small**
![small](resources/small.png?raw=true "small")

**medium**
![small](resources/medium.png?raw=true "medium")

**large**
![small](resources/large.png?raw=true "large")

**Points to evaluate:**

- semantic HTML
- suitcss
- box model
- position relative and absolute
- flexbox
- relative units
- mobile first
- media query
